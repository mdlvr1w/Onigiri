This is Onigiri, a KDE Plasma Tiling helper based on PyQt6.

Onigiri takes advantage of KDE KWin-Rules. The user creates a Layout and Onigiri writes respective KWin Rules accordingly.

Thebuilt in Canvas allows users to create recursive tiling layouts simply by right-clicking on the canvas and creating vertical or horizontal splits which are then free draggable to their desired position.

Creating custom tiles is super easy thanks to the built-in tile editor - allowing the user to choose from raw command konsole tiles, konsole helper with easier command setup or choosing applications via a dropdown menu.

Onigiri is the product of vibecoding. I am not a Coder - tho i wish i was.. but iam not. Therefore i would appreciate if someone with actual coding skills would either step into the project as a mentor or take over the project entirely.
I dont take any praise for the creation of the code, all i did was writing prompts and troubleshooting - everyone could do that. While i do think that vibecoding doesnt necessarily require any skills - i do want to point out that it took me quite some time to get Onigiri to the state it is in right now. I still try to advance the code daily and push for more features, if something is broken right now or doesnt work as expected, please let me know so i can try to get the AI to fix it properly.

Thanks for your attention.
